# OpenEM Depositor of EM data to International Repositories

This repository provides a depositor app backend on top of SciCat frontend that allows users to seamlessly  deposit their data to OneDep system. OneDep covers depositions to PDB end EMDB.\\
This depositor is designed for Swiss OpenEm project and supports only depositions to OneDep that are experimentally based on methods covered by Electron Microscopes. \\
OneDep defines an obligatory set of files required to create a deposition. Subsequently, they are all necessary for this depositor too. Additionally, the user can provide an extra file with metadata that will be accepted by the depositor and appended to the deposition. This metadata file must be in json format and follow the [OSC-EM schema](https://github.com/osc-em/OSCEM_Schemas) supported by OpenEM. Once provided, this metadata will be automatically [converted to mmCIF format](https://github.com/osc-em/converter-OSCEM-to-mmCIF) accepted by OneDep. If deposition is destined to PDB, a new mmCIF file will be created containing both metadata and coordinates model provided by the user. For EMDB depositions a brand new mmCIF file will be created. \\
